            <p>
              Hello, my name is Hayden Comer and this is my third year at USCA.
              I have been playing the guitar for about 8 years and I love to work on computers.
              In my spare time, I also edit videos and attempt to sketch different things
              I also like to play video games including Elden Ring which is one of my favorites.

                    <ul>
                        <li>In this project, we created software that would take user input via a GUI and chart a 
                            flight from one airport to another airport to another using a user-selected airplane.</li>
                        <li> We had to learn Jtable to complete the GUI in this project</li>
                        <li>We also had to learn how to work as a team and how to generate different database organizing documents</li>
                        <li> We created our own database structure to contain all the information that was input by a user</li>
                    </ul>
